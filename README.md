# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repository contains few of the projects that I personally undertook to enhance my Deep Learning skills and understand behavior of data and associated patterns in accordance.

* **Advanced Recommender System** | MovieLens Dataset | Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) | PyTorch | Built a Recommender system to classify movies intended to be either Liked(1) or Disliked(0) by a User based on previously provided trend of ratings.

* **Detecting & Classifying Fraudsters** | Credit Approval Dataset | Artificial Neural Classifier (ANN) with Self Organizing Map (SOM) | Keras + MiniSOM | Built an Unsupervised SOM to visualize Outliers who had applied for Credit Cards and then predict potential users who would get involved in fraud as per existing trend.

* **Predicting Milk Production over Time** | Monthly milk production: pounds per cow (Jan 62 â€“ Dec 75) | Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) | TensorFlow | Built a supervised RNN model to predict Milk production per cow (in pounds) for a time period of 12 months as per previous year trends.

* **Reducing Dimensions** | MNIST Dataset | Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) | TensorFlow | We have our dataset with approximately 30 attributes that we will reduce to just 2 using a Stacked Autoencoder.

* **Elementary Image Classifier** | MNIST Dataset | Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) | TensorFlow

* **Sentiment Analysis + Classifier** | Raw Text Data Scrapped | Deep CNN with Word2Vec | PyTorch
