# Deep-Learning-Projects
This repository contains few of the projects that I have personally undertaken to enhance my skills and understand behavior of data and associated patterns or best-fitted predictions.

1> Advanced Recommender System | MovieLens Dataset | Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) | PyTorch
   [Built a Recommender system to classify movies intended to be either Liked(1) or Disliked(0) by a User as per the previously provided trend of ratings.]

2> Detecting & Classifying Fraudsters | Credit Approval Dataset | Artificial Neural Classifier (ANN) with Self Organizing Map (SOM) | Keras + MiniSOM 
   [Built an Unsupervised SOM to visualize Outliers who had applied for Credit Cards and then predict ptential users who would get involved in fraud as per the trend.]

3> Predicting Milk Production over Time | Monthly milk production: pounds per cow (Jan 62 â€“ Dec 75) | Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) | TensorFlow on GPU
   [Built a supervised RNN model to predict Milk production per cow (in pounds) for a time period of 12 months as per previous year trends.]

4> Reducing Dimensions | MNIST Dataset | Stacked Autoencoder (SAE) | TensorFlow  [We have our dataset with approximately 30 attributes that we will reduce to just 2 using a Stacked Autoencoder.]
